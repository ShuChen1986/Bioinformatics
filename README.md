This pipeline is used in our paper 'Optimizing Transcriptome Assemblies for Eleusine indica Leaf and Seedling by Combining Multiple Assemblies from Three De Novo Assemblers'. It used three programs, USEARCH (http://www.drive5.com/usearch/), CD-HIT-EST (http://weizhong-lab.ucsd.edu/cd-hit/) and EvidentialGene script 'tr2aacds' (http://arthropods.eugenes.org/EvidentialGene/about/EvidentialGene_trassembly_pipe.html).
